# ⚡ What Can Hypercompute Do?

> Hypercompute is a decentralized GPU marketplace — connect to powerful GPUs around the world, or share your own and earn. No setup. No middlemen.

Here’s what you can do with Hypercompute:

1. 🧠 **Run AI/ML workloads on remote GPUs**  
   Instantly connect to decentralized GPUs for model training, fine-tuning, or inference — all without cloud accounts or DevOps.

2. 💸 **Earn by Renting Out Your GPU**  
   Contribute your idle GPU to the network and get paid for the compute you provide — securely and on your terms.

3. 🔄 **Share Compute Between Friends, Teams, or Orgs**  
   Securely tunnel workloads to trusted GPUs without dealing with SSH keys, IPs, or VPNs.

4. 🎮 **Offload Game Rendering or Simulation Tasks**  
   Tap into remote GPUs for rendering, game server hosting, or physics simulations — peer-to-peer.

5. 🔐 **Maintain Full Privacy and Control**  
   All connections are encrypted and authenticated. You choose who uses your GPU, for how long, and what workloads are allowed.
