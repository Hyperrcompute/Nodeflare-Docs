# Hyperrcompute Terminology

Master the essentials of the Hyperrcompute ecosystem with this concise terminology guide.

---

## 🔌 Core Terms

### Connection String

A secure identifier that enables peer-to-peer communication between nodes in the Hyperrcompute network.

**Example:** `89fd199803cd2aaf4b5cdba373a970a9e6a08f86547f26c24aae3efee062`

> Treat it like a password—confidential and private.

### Provider

A user who contributes compute resources (CPU/GPU) to the network and earns HCC tokens in return.

### Consumer

A user who rents computing resources from the network to run jobs, train models, or deploy containers.

## ⚙️ Technical Components

### Ephemeral Container

A temporary container that self-destructs after completing its task.

### TCP Tunnel

Creates a secure bridge between your machine and a remote container (e.g., for Jupyter access).

### Live Mode (`--live`)

Streams logs, metrics, and output in real time during container execution.

## 💰 Payment & Resource Units

### HCC Token

The native token used for payments and rewards across the platform.

### Compute Credits

Simplified units for tracking resource usage (e.g., 1 GPU hour = 100 credits).

## 🛡️ Security & Network

### SERVER\_KEY

An auto-generated key stored in `.env` to securely authenticate nodes.

### JWT Token

Used for secure API access and container session validation.

### Private Network

Encrypted peer-to-peer mesh enabling secure, decentralized execution.
