# Public vs Private Connections

In Hypercompute, you can choose how open or secure your connection is:

## Public

- Anyone with the link can access.
- Good for sharing demos or test apps.
- Easy and quick.

## Private

- Only trusted users can connect.
- Uses encryption and secure keys.
- Best for personal files, servers, or remote access.

> Tip: Hypercompute defaults to **private** mode for safety.
