## 🔥 What Is Hypercompute?

Hypercompute is a **peer-to-peer GPU network** that enables:

- Renting compute from **distributed GPUs** around the world
- Sharing your own GPU for others to use — and earn
- Running ML models, inference jobs, rendering, simulations, etc.
- Full control over **who accesses your machine** and when

All powered by a lightweight, zero-setup, decentralized stack.
